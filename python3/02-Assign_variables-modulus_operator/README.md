# 34.2 PRACTICE: Assign variables, modulus operator (%)

**Instructions:**

Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.

---

**Task:**

Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing any number of ounces. Output the converted total number of tons, pounds, and remaining ounces based on the input ounces values. There are 16 ounces in a pound and 2,000 pounds in a ton.

The solutino output should be in the format:

```Python
Tons: value_1
Pounds: value_2
Ounces: value_3
```

---
**Sample Input/Output:**  

If the input is

```Python
32035
```

then the expected output is

```Python
Tons: 1
Pounds: 2
Ounces: 3
```
